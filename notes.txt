Predict whether an expedition will be successful (reach the summit) based on factors like:
Number of team members
Season of expedition
Use of oxygen
Route chosen
Team composition (number of hired personnel)
This would be valuable for expedition planning and risk assessment


Summit Time Prediction
Predict how long it will take to reach the summit from base camp
This could help in expedition planning and resource allocation
Features could include: team size, experience level, weather conditions, route chosen


Risk Assessment Model
Predict the likelihood of accidents or fatalities
This would be crucial for safety planning
Could use features like: team size, experience level, weather conditions, route difficulty


Member Success Prediction
Predict whether an individual climber will successfully reach the summit
Features could include: age, experience, previous attempts, team size, use of oxygen


Peak Difficulty Classification
Create a model to classify peaks based on their difficulty level
Could use features like: success rate, number of attempts, average time to summit, fatality rate
