EverestIQ
A Machine Learning-Powered Expedition Success and Risk Assessment Platform
Overview
EverestIQ is a predictive analytics system designed to analyze historical Himalayan expedition data and provide valuable insights for mountaineering planning and safety. Leveraging machine learning, EverestIQ predicts expedition outcomes, assesses risks, and classifies mountain peaks by difficulty to assist climbers, guides, and planners in making data-driven decisions.
With the increasing popularity and risks of high-altitude expeditions, EverestIQ empowers stakeholders by forecasting success probabilities, summit durations, and fatality likelihoods — thereby improving preparation, safety, and strategic planning.
Goals
To predict whether an expedition will be successful based on logistical and environmental factors.
To assess the risk of fatalities or accidents during expeditions.
To estimate the time it might take for a team to summit a peak.
To classify Himalayan peaks based on historical expedition data to understand their difficulty levels.
To develop a modular and interpretable machine learning framework using real expedition records.
System Features Overview:
Dashboard
Visual analytics of expedition outcomes, success rates, and fatality statistics.
Searchable peak profiles with historical difficulty ratings.
Expedition Success Prediction
Predicts whether a planned expedition will reach the summit.
Useful for risk evaluation and preparation.
Risk Assessment Tool
Estimates the probability of fatalities based on historical patterns and expedition profiles.
Summit Time Estimation (if data allows)
Predicts the estimated duration from base to summit.
Assists in planning timelines and resource allocations.
Peak Difficulty Classification
Categorizes Himalayan peaks as Easy, Moderate, or Hard.
Uses success rate, number of attempts, and fatality rate.
